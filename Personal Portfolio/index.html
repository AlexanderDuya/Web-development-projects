            <h4>About Me</h4>
            <H1>Hi, I'm <span>Alexander</span>, an aspiring software engineer</H1>
            <p>
                I am a first year student pursuing a BSc in Computer Science at Kingston University, where I am learning software engineering fundamentals and developing my skills in Python, JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Java, and SQL. My goal is to become a detail-oriented and innovative software engineer who can create impactful solutions for real-world problems.

I am also a self-motivated entrepreneur who runs two successful businesses in the hospitality and fashion industries. As an Airbnb host, I manage guest bookings, property preparation, financial management, and customer communication, resulting in consistent 5-star ratings and positive feedback. As a retail arbitrageur, I leverage market trends and pricing dynamics to buy and sell fashion items online, generating a 4-figure monthly income and building a loyal customer base. Through these experiences, I have honed my analytical, organizational, leadership, and networking skills, as well as my adaptability and resilience.
